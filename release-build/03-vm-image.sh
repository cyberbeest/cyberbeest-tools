# Same category of cleanup remaster-live-stick.sh already does on its own
# working copy (see its "Sanitizing the copy" section) -- applied here to
# our own independent copy, never to $SRC directly, since 04-remaster.sh
# still needs to boot $SRC afterward (e.g. deleting its NetworkManager
# connection profile here could leave that later boot without networking).
# Deliberately does NOT touch /etc/fstab or /etc/crypttab (remaster blanks
# those since a live-stick boots via live-boot/squashfs+overlay, not its
# own real disk -- this VM image boots its own real attached qcow2
# normally, so real fstab/crypttab entries are exactly what it needs).
# Also strips /etc/cyberbeest/dev-test-vm-marker (provisioning/lib/mark-
# dev-test-vm.sh) defensively: $SRC comes from a fresh 02-provision.sh run
# and should never actually have it, but if a donor image were ever reused
# by mistake, this is the last line of defense against dev-rig overrides
# (autologin, no lock screen -- see 90-vm-mode-overrides.sh) leaking into
# an actual customer build.
# Also strips the build network's apt-cacher-ng proxy setting
# (Acquire::http::Proxy) baked into /etc/apt/apt.conf by debian-installer's
# mirror/http/proxy preseed value at base-install time -- unreachable from
# outside tower's network, so every apt operation on a real customer machine
# would fail until this is stripped. Found 2026-09-20, same category as the
# dev-test-vm-marker strip above: build-only state that must never reach a
# shipped artifact.
# /var/log: only the files go, not the directories -- the old
# `rm -rf /var/log/*` also deleted e.g. /var/log/exim4, after which exim4
# failed at every boot of the image (on the boot's critical chain, and
# leaving the system "degraded"). Found 2026-09-25.
